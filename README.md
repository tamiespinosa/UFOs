## <a name="OverviewProject"></a>Overview of Project

In this project we are building a website to show different UFO sightings [[1]](#1) using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3. The UFO sighting data [[2]](#2) is collected and filtered JavaScript code [[3]](#3) and displayed using HTML [[1]](#1).Some of the website's csutomization was done in the HTML file and some was done in the CSS file [[4]](#4). The website has dynamic functionality for filtering the data displayed. D3 is ustilized to recognize the user inputs ("changes") to the website and filter the information accordingly.

## <a name="Summary"></a> Summary

We were succesfully able to build a website that presents the UFO sighting data and has five filtering categories. Filters can be applied to multiple catergories simultaneously. The drawback of the website is that it accepts any text to filter the data, without considering potential capitalization issues and mispellings. Ideally, some of these filters could be drop down lists to limit the user input to only filters that exhist.
